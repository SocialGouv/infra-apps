# Base values for the no-package-malware umbrella chart.
#
# These values are applied in all environments. Environment-specific
# overrides (e.g. production) are defined in sibling files such as
# `values.prod.yaml` and merged on top of this file by ArgoCD/Helm.

no-package-malware:
  # By default, keep ingress disabled at the base level and let
  # environment-specific values (e.g. values.prod.yaml) enable it
  # with the appropriate hosts and TLS configuration.
